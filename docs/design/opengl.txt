Why do it?
----------

Using 3D Hardware to do rendering would be faster than using software.

In addition it will remove the need to do sorting on opaque shapes as a 
Z-buffer can be used.


Basics
------

Obviously use SDL to create the frame buffer and GL Context.

SDL_GL_GetProcAddress will be used to get OpenGL functions rather than do
static links. This would allow for a unified method of accessing extension
functions on all platforms. Also allows use of multiple OpenGL drivers, and for
the end user to choose the driver (advanced users only perhaps). It also allows
OpenGL enabled binaries to run on systems that don't have OpenGL installed, 
assuming that software renderer support is also enabled.


Extensions
----------

The following OpenGL extensions would be useful, and would be used:
 - GL_EXT_compiled_vertex_array
 - GL_EXT_paletted_texture

The following extensions might be used for special effects
 - GL_ARB_multitexture
 - GL_ARB_texture_env_combine


Shapes -> Textures
------------------

Converting shapes to textures would be a simple process.

Each frame of every shape gets drawn into a texture that is big enough to hold
it (note that shapes shouldn't be allowed to touch the edges of textures). 

The offset of the center of the shape in the texture will need to be recorded
to ensure the shape is drawn at the correct position. 

Paletted textures should be used if possible (user selectable though). This
will reduce the amount of texture memory required. Next preference would
probably be ARGB8888 then ARGB1555 and lastly ARGB4444. XFormed shapes need
more that just a single bit of Alpha, so they would need either 8888 or 4444.
The preference would be 8888 as 4444 has a really low amount of colours. For
normal textures the loss of the 1 bit of precision in the palette (the palette
has 6 bit colours) when using 1555 will be virtually unnoticiable.

Recommended settings would be paletted for both normal and xformed textures if 
supported, and ARGB1555 for normal and ARGB8888 for Xformed.


Scaling
-------

Prescaling shapes using one of Kreed's scalers should be possible. It would
probably be a good idea to scale the shape, and it's mask separatly, rather
than attempting to use a colour key. Using ARGB8888 would pretty much be
requried.


Drawing Shapes
--------------

Drawing Shapes as sprites isn't sufficent. The shapes need to be mapped to
their bouding boxes and drawn that way.

A cheap nasty hack could automatically generate the bounding boxes to draw from
the collision detection boxes. However, many shapes go outside of their bouding
boxes, and wouldn't be completly drawn. 

So, most shapes will require special custom bounding boxes or meshes be created
for them with the correct mappings. This would be a fairly simple process to
do, should a tool be created to do it. Shpdisp could reasonably easily be
modifed to perform these duties.

It would probably be best to auto generate the meshes and then modify them
later. This would get something up and running fairly quickly and would
allow for fine tuning later.

The actual drawing would be as simple as putting the coords of the shape into
the modelview matrix, putting the shape offset into the texture matrix, putting
the camera position into the projection matrix, binding the texture, and then
drawing the tri's that make up the box.

All the boxes could be loaded into one single large vertex array as only a few
thousand verts would be used, and in many cases, optimizations could be done to
remove duplicates. Since the vertex array never needs to be modified, compiled
vertex array will give a speed improvement.


Globs
-----

Glob drawing could in theory be placed into display lists. They will always be
the same and using display lists will improve efficency. It should improve
speed somewhat.

Since on screen checking at the shape level wont be done, it will have to be
done at the glob level. Doing this would be as simple as calculating the
rectangle of screenspace taken up by all the shapes in the glob combined. It
has it's inefficencies, but should be good enough. There will never be 'that'
many triangles, so it's extremely unlikely doing this will cause a
transformation bottle neck. Using display lists and culling on the glob level
should more than make up for a few extra triangles being transformed.


XForm Handling
--------------

XForms for the most part just seem to be doing simple alpha blending. When a
shape is converted to a texture that has the Transparent bit set, it will have
the XFormed colours converted to equivilant Alpha blended colours.


Tracing mouse clicks 
--------------------

Generally tracing mouse clicks requires sorted shapes. However since the shapes
are never sorted things can't really be done that way.

However, all is not lost. A mini list of objects could be created that possibly
might have clicked on (i.e. do bounding checks to determine the possiblity of a
click). 

So the following can be done when a mouse click occurs:
 - Do a bounding check for every shape that IS on screen to determine if the
   mouse was over it at the last render
 - If the mouse was, add it to a list
 - Sort the list
 - Start from the top and traverse down the list to find the first shape that
   was actually clicked and return that

This method will be fractionally slower than using a list that was sorted when
rendering but only when the click occurs.


Reducing Texture and Driver Memory Usage
----------------------------------------

One problem is the amount of texture memory usage could be high. The easiest
way to reduce texture memory usage would be to discard all shapes that are not
required after a map change. People with 64 or 128 MB cards should be ok, and
they could probably leave all textures in Memory. However, this will also
increase the amount of driver memory required! Pentagram will require a
substantial amount of texture memory. I'm guessing with 8 bit textures, more
than 20 MB of textures will be used! Double this for 16 bit, and quadruple for
32 bit!

See "Map Changes" section for more details on what to do.


Map Changes
-----------
When on a map change the following will occur:

 - Get rid of all old map data
 - Destroy Glob Display lists
 - Discard all textures (except for things that will obviously be needed)
 - Load new map, and mark all the required shapes and globs
 - Load all the required shapes
 - Setup Glob Display lists (when first rendered?)


Palette Effects
---------------

Ultima 8 doesn't do palette cycling however it does do some palette blending
(storms, and rain of fire)

Rather than modfying the global palette (and reuploading all textures in some
cases), it is a better idea to draw a trans polygon over the entire screen
and get the hardware to do the blending. This would also allow the world to be
modified, but text and gumps left alone.


Special Effects
---------------

Shape Blending:

Using multipass to blend certain animated textures can produce pleasing
effects. Fire textures are a good example. This could be done in Pentagram.
Note that this will not work on 'all' types of sprites. This is unsuitable for
shapes that use XForm, and shapes that change their 'shape'. Doing this would
require special handling of the meshes.

Blending XForm shapes and shapes that change 'shape' requires using
multitexture and also using the GL_ARB_texture_env_combine extension.

Using an add blend mode (glBlendFunc(GL_ONE, GL_ONE)) on certain fire shapes
might look quite nice. Incidently using add allows for multiple frames to be
blended without requiring multitexture and GL_ARB_texture_env_combine.

Perspective Transformations:

It would be possible to add a Diablo 2 like Perspective mode. While it would
look rather cool, adding such a mode would create numerous annoying issues with
mouse click detections. It would make it exceedingly difficult to accuractly 
determine what the user clicked on in some circumstances

Lighting:

It would be possible to create some funky lighting effects for around what
would be a light source. U8 doesn't define light sources so we would have to do
it ourselves. Only issue is how to exactly to actually implement the idea.
i.e. brighten areas around light sources, or darken things away from them.
Regardless, the lighting system would have to custom designed.


Further Possiblities
--------------------

Sometime in the far future some crazy people may decide to rework the shapes
and replace them with 3D Models and textures. Adding support for such features
would be fairly trivial.


Comments
--------

Thinking about it using bouding boxes and z buffering for all shapes may not be
entirely the best solution. Animated Shapes and Actors can tend to have very
irregular shapes, and bouding boxes do not fit the shapes at all.

So, currently my thinking is a follows:

 * Render all 'regular' objects with full z buffer enabled. These are objects
   that can be rendered using a bounding box, and aren't transparent.
 * Render all 'irregular' and transparent objects as sprites but only z
   checking. The sprites will be Z sorted.

Over time more complex 3d models could be made to properly fit the irregular
shapes. Assuming that people just don't decide to create entire animated 3d
models which would just be so cool... and who knows, I may even do some models
myself. :-)

I personally think the data should be stored in our XML styled config files.
For development this could be loaded from an external file, but for public 
releases it would be put into a flex.

Data required would:
 * Per frame adjusted bouding boxes
 * Sprite Flag
 * Additive Blend Mode Flag
 * Interpolated animation Flag

More details later...

*** Added 2002-04-14 ***

Just so I remember, here are the matrix settings. There maybe a few negetives
around the wrong way in places.

Just some comments about the details. The assumption is the bottom left hand
corner of the screen is 0,0 and Z increase into the screen. This acts as if the
camera is below the world looking directly up.

This is used to set up the projection and model view matrices for the camera:

	// First edit projection matrix
	glMatrixMode (GL_PROJECTION);			

	// Load Identity
	glLoadIdentity ();

	// Setup screen coords
	gluOrtho (-resx/2, resx/2, -resy/2, resy/2, -256, 256);

	// Now Edit modelview matrix
	glMatrixMode (GL_MODELVIEW);			

	// Load Identity
	glLoadIdentity ();

	// Rotate so we have a view that is 60 degree from looking straight down
	glRotatef (120, 1, 0, 0);

	// Rotate by around z axis by 45 degrees
	glRotatef (45, 0, 0, 1);

	// Now we move to where the camera is
	glTranslatef (-camera.x, -camera.y, -camera.z);

These are the changes to the model view marix when rendering each object:

	// Edit modelview matrix
	glMatrixMode (GL_MODELVIEW);			

	// Push the matrix
	glPushMatrix();

	// Move it
	glTranslatef (object.x, object.y, object.x);

	// Rotate it about z axis (only needed for mesh objects)
	if (object.mesh) {
		float angle = object.frame_info[object.frame].angle;

		if (object.flags & FLIPPED) angle = -angle;
	
		glRotatef (angle, 0, 0, 1);
	}
	// or if we are not a mesh and need flipping then do flip.
	else if (object.flags & FLIPPED) {
	
		// Un rotate
		glRotatef (45, 0, 0, 1);

		// Scale it
		glScalf (-1, 1, 1);

		// Rotate it so we can scale across x and y at the same time
		glRotatef (-45, 0, 0, 1);
	}

	// Render the object
	object->Render();

	// Pop the matrix
	glPopMatrix();


Now that is out of the way,I get on with more 'thoughts' about things...

I have been considering the format to use for 3D Meshes. I stongly thinking
about using the MD3 format. There are numerous tools for this format available
and it pretty much has all the sort of features that I would want. Pentagram
will not have an skeletal animation, so a deformed mesh object format is
wanted. Also, if I do use MD3's i wont have to bother about writing file
format converters.

Textures I think should be supplied using PNGs. Exult pngio could pretty easily
be used to do this.

The meshes and textures shouldn't be supplied using a flex. There are a few
reasons for this, mostly being flexes don't have filenames, and it would be
easier if the models and textures could be accessed using filenames, not
indices. I'm thinking that a standard zip file should be used, but named
something like FLZ instead. 

Proposed format of bounding box data config file

"shapes/num"			// Number of shapes defined.
"shapes/%i"			// Definition for a shape (%i is from 0 to "shapes/num")
"shapes/%i/shape"		// Actual shape number
"shapes/%i/box"			// Global bounding box (xfrom yfrom zfrom xto yto zto)
"shapes/%i/flags"		// Flags for this shape (a=additive, i=interp, m=mesh, s=sprite)
"shapes/%i/mesh"		// Mesh config filename
"shapes/%i/overrides"		// Per frame overrides
"shapes/%i/overrides/num"	// Number of overrider
"shapes/%i/overrides/%i"	// Frame override
"shapes/%i/overrides/%i/frame"	// Actual frame of override
"shapes/%i/overrides/%i/box"	// Bounding box for frame

Not all shapes will require a config file entry. Only those that do not behave
and go outside of their default bouding box will need one, or mesh objects.

Mesh objects will have a seperate animation config file. This config file will
map frames in the md3. Since such a huge number of frames is requried I'm
thinking that conf is not ideal. A quick format is needed. Here is my current 
idea:

model <modelname>
frames <framecount>
<shapeframe> <md3frame> <md3angle>
<shapeframe> <md3frame> <md3angle>
...
<shapeframe> <md3frame> <md3angle>
<shapeframe> <md3frame> <md3angle>

The format is simple enough and will be quick to read. Things might tend to
screw up a bit with an invalid file, but I don't really care.

Question: Do we need to support MD3 tags? Yes we do. They need to be used for
our good friend toaster head and his weapons.

Question: Should we support shaders? Current thinking is no. We don't need that
flexibility.


Generating Vertices
-------------------

Pentagram will automatically generate the verts for the shapes. The process is
rather simple. Firstly we get the bounding box. Then we generate the base UV
map. We can do these at the same time, so we will. Note that the Bottom real
vert doesn't touch any triangles that are front facing.

void GenerateVertices(Vertex verts[8], TexCoord uv[8], const sint32 xrange[2], const sint32 yrange[2], const sint32 zrange[2])
{
	//
	// Normally these are what the values should be of the range args
	// should be passed like this:
	//
	// xrange[0] = 0;
	// xrange[1] = ShapeInfo::get_x() * -8;
	// yrange[0] = 0;
	// yrange[1] = ShapeInfo::get_x() * -8;
	// zrange[0] = ShapeInfo::get_x() * 8;
	// zrange[1] = 0;
	//
	// On screen the 8 points will be in these positions. Note this is
	// ASSUMED in places so you had better be sure you pass the points
	// correctly
	//
	// 0 = Top Front
	// 1 = Top Left
	// 2 = Top Right
	// 3 = Top Rear
	// 4 = Bottom Front
	// 5 = Bottom Left
	// 6 = Bottom Right
	// 7 = Bottom Rear

	for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {

		// Generate verts
		verts[i].x = xrange[i&1];	// Bit 0 is X
		verts[i].y = yrange[(i>>1)&1];	// Bit 1 is Y
		verts[i].z = zrange[(i>>2)&1];	// Bit 2 is Z

		// Generate UV mapping
		uv[i].u =  verts[i].x - verts[i].y;
		uv[i].v = (verts[i].x + verts[i].y)/2 - verts[i].z;
	}
}

Now that the verts and uvmap is generated, it's time to get the uv scale and
offsets for each frame. Doing this isn't as simple as it would seem. The
following needs to be done for each frame in each shape

// Frame texture transform structure
struct FrameTexTrans {
	float	scale[2];
	float	offset[2];
}

void GenerateFrameTextTrans (FrameTexTrans *textrans, const ShapeFrame *frame, const int texwidth, const int texheight)
{
	// Note:
	//
	// texwidth and texheight are the actual dimentions of the opengl texture
	// width and height are the dimentions of the shape
	// xoff and yoff are the shape offsets

	textrans->scale[0] = ((float) frame->width) / ((float) texwidth);
	textrans->scale[1] = ((float) frameheight) / ((float) texheight);

	textrans->offset[0] = 1 + frame->xoff;
	textrans->offset[1] = 1 + frame->yoff;
}

We need to get the texture size of the texture to create. We do this by just
getting getting a number that is larger or equal to the dimension that is a 
power of 2.

void GetTexDims (int &texwidth, int &texheight, const ShapeFrame *frame, const bool square = false)
{
	texwidth = 1;
	while (texwidth < frame->width) texwidth <<= 1;

	texheight = 1;
	while (texheight < frame->height) texheight <<= 1;

	if (square) {
		if (texwidth > texheight) texheight = texwidth;
		else texwidth = texheight;
	}
}



Details on MD3 Format
---------------------

Here are specs on the MD3 format. Everything uses little endian byte order

struct MD3_Header {
	char	type[4];	// "IDP3"
	uint32	version;	// 15
	char	name[64];	// Name of model
	
	uint32	unknown0;	// Usage???

	uint32	num_frames;	// Number of frame
	uint32	num_tags;	// Number or tags
	uint32	num_surfs;	// Number of surfaces

	uint32	unknown1;	// Usage???

	uint32	offset_finfo;	// Offset of frame info (from start of header)
	uint32	offset_tags;	// Offset of tags
	uint32	offset_surfs;	// Offset of surfaces

	uint32	offset_end;	// Offset to end of file
};

struct MD3_FrameInfo {
	float	box_min[3];	// Bounding Box lower extents
	float	box_max[3];	// Bounding Box greater extents
	float	origin[3];	// Local origin (center of model)
	float	radius;		// Radius from origin
	char	name[16];	// Name of frame
};

struct MD3_Tag {
	char	name[64];	// Tag name
	float	origin[3];	// Tag origin
	float	axis[3][3];	// Tag Matrix (vectors forward=0, right=1 and up=2)
};

struct MD3_Surface {
	char	type[4];	// "IDP3"
	char	name[64];	// Name of surface

	uint32	unknown0;	// Usage???
	
	uint32	num_frames;	// Number of frames. Must be the same as in header
	uint32	num_shaders;	// Number of shaders/textures for this surface
	uint32	num_verts;	// Number of verts for this surface
	uint32	num_tris;	// Number of triangles for this surface

	uint32	offset_tris;	// Offset to tris (from start of surf)
	uint32	offset_shaders;	// Offset to shaders
	uint32	offset_uv;	// Offset to texture coords 
	uint32	offset_verts;	// Offset to verts and normals

	uint32	offset_next;	// Offset from start of this surface to next surface
};

struct MD3_Shader {
	char	filename[64];	// Filename of shader
	uint32	index;		// Shader index
};

struct MD3_Triangle {
	uint32	indices[3];	// Triangle incidces
};

struct MD3_TexCoord {
	float	uv[2];		// UV coords
};

struct MD3_Vertex {
	sint16	xyz[3];		// Vertex

	uint8	longitude;	// Normal longigude (0 to 255 == 0 to 2*PI)
	uint8	latitude;	// Normal latitiude (0 to 255 == 0 to 2*PI)

	// Get the vertex
	inline void GetVertex(float vertex[3]) {
		vertex[0] = xyz[0] / 64.0F;
		vertex[1] = xyz[1] / 64.0F;
		vertex[2] = xyz[2] / 64.0F;
	}

	// Get the normal
	inline void GetNormal(float normal[3]) {
		normal[0] = cos((longitude*M_PI)/255.0F) * sin((latitude*M_PI)/255.0F);
		normal[1] = sin((longitude*M_PI)/255.0F) * sin((latitude*M_PI)/255.0F);
		normal[2] = cos((latitude*M_PI)/255.0F);
	}
};

Since the normal long and lat are coded into bytes, converting can be sped up 
by putting the sin and cos into lookup tables.

Applying tags is simple. This is how to multiple a vertex by a tag:

void Rotate3x3(float out[3], float in[3], float r[3][3])
{
	out[0] = in[0]*r[0][0] + in[1]*r[1][0] + in[2]*r[2][0];
	out[1] = in[0]*r[0][1] + in[1]*r[1][1] + in[2]*r[2][1];
	out[2] = in[0]*r[0][2] + in[1]*r[1][2] + in[2]*r[2][2];
}

The following 'should' in thoery generate an opengl matrix to do that, and then
multiply the current OpenGL matrix by that.

void OGLMatrixRotate3x3(float r[3][3])
{
	GLfloat m[16];

	m[0x0]=r[0][0];	m[0x4]=r[1][0];	m[0x8]=r[2][0];	m[0xC]=0;	
	m[0x1]=r[0][1];	m[0x5]=r[1][1];	m[0x9]=r[2][1];	m[0xD]=0;	
	m[0x2]=r[0][2];	m[0x6]=r[1][2];	m[0xA]=r[2][2];	m[0XE]=0;	
	m[0x3]=0;	m[0x7]=0;	m[0xB]=0;	m[0xF]=1;

	glMultMatrixf (m);
}


Results of first attempt
------------------------

The results of the first attempt at writing an OpenGL renderer was somewhat
successful. It was fast, which I was kind of not expecting.

The texture usage estimations above appeared correct. Some maps used way more
textures than others and as such used more texture memory. Daemon's Crag was
the worst using almost 21 MB of 16 bit textures at Precache Level 3.

Bilinear filtering basically showed up the only issue using OpenGL to render.
What occuring was if filtering was enabled, gaps and lines would appear between
the ground flats. This is because they are being painted as sprites and OpenGL
was attempting to Alpha Blend them. They would either get black edges,
transparent edges, or in some attempt to fixs the problem, odd looking
artefacts.

There are 2 things that need to be done to fix this problem. Draw the flats as
3D objects and unpremodulate the alpha channel This first is easy, the second
is extremely difficult.

Unpremodulating the alpha is going to be difficult because the flats don't
always tile with themselves in both directions. When the textures are generated
I am going to have to know what a suitable texture to put next to the edges
are. This could be done automatically, but would be slow, or it could be  done
manually, which would also be slow. I need to think about this. This same issue
will also appear when using scalers so it needs to be fixed.

Another things I realised was sprites should not be treated the same as flats
or structure pieces. Sprites were tending to get hard egdes when bilinear
filtering was enabled. They really needed alpha blending on the edges.

Something that looked really quite cool was running in 4x or 8x FSAA with Alpha
Blending enabled. When scaling it just fixed up problems with hard edges.
However when not scaling and using a high screen res the entire screen was
smoothed out a bit. I was quite surprised that much of the stair stepping in
the diagonal lines was removed. While it did make things a little fuzzy, this
tended to get rid of dithering. The overall effect looked really good. I may
attempt to write a 'scaler' of sorts that has the same effect for software
rendering.

Texture management can be improved. I was thinking that multiple frames in a
sprite should be made to use the same texture. This should hopefully reduce the
amount of wasted texture space. A silimar thing could be done with tiles, but
it would really need to be handled differently.

That's all for now.
