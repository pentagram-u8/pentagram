U8's anim.dat:
------------------

anim.dat contains common animation sequences for actors.

at offset 0 is a lookup table containing 2048 4-byte (absolute) offsets into 
anim.dat (one for each shape). Offset is zero if the shape is no actor.

These shape offsets point at more lookup tables. Each of these tables
consists of 64 4-byte (absolute) offsets. These point to the actual
frame sequences. The 64 sequences are specific 'actions'. They're listed below.

Frame sequences have the following format:
4 byte header:
byte 0: length of sequences
byte 1: flags: bit 0: two-step animation
	       bit 1: attack
               bit 2: looping animation
	       bit 3: unstoppable (don't stop animation if blocked)
	       bit 4: unknown
	       bit 5: unknown
	       bit 6: unknown
               bit 7: hanging
byte 2, bits 0-3: time to show each frame (not sure which unit)
byte 2, bits 4-7: unknown
byte 3: flags: bit 7: destroy actor after animation

header is followed by 8 * length 6-byte frame entries: 
(8 = number of directions, in the order N NE E SE S SW W NW) 

byte 0 + lowest 3 bits of byte 1: frame number
byte 1, bit 3: interruptable?
	bit 4: unknown (only used for troll,daemon,skeleton,eyebeast, act.14)
	bit 5-7: unused
byte 2: change in Z coordinate
byte 3: SFX# to play (zero for none?)
byte 4: movement in 'main' direction. (* 4 units)
byte 5:	bit 0: unknown (only used when moving backwards?)
	bit 1: on the ground
	bit 2-4: attack range
	bit 5: flipped
	bits 6-7: unused
