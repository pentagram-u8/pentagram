* use 0-based file offsets
* updated glob placement formulas

Introduction & notes
====================
Data for the Ultima 8 maps are stored in multiple files. Each files purpose
and format can be found in the appropriate section of this document. There
are probably more files relating to the maps, but I haven't worked out which
ones yet.

All numbers are in decimal.

FIXED.DAT and NONFIXED.DAT format
=================================
FIXED.DAT can be found in the static directory and NONFIXED.DAT can be found
in the GAMEDAT directory or inside U8SAVE.000 in the SAVEGAME directory (See:
Getting data from save games). FIXED.DAT contains all the objects that are in
a fixed position (Floor, walls, trees) and NONFIXED.DAT contains all the
objects that can be moved around and will stay where you put them (Swords,
keys, etc)

--- Header chunk ---
This tells you how many maps there are, the file positon of the maps and the
size of each map

Offset   Size   Description
    84      2   Number of maps in file (m) (Should be 256)
   128    m*8   Map information chunks

--- Map information chunk ---
There should be 256 maps in the file. The first map is Map 0 in the game and
the 256th map is Map 255 in the game.

Offset   Size   Description
     0      4   Position in file of beginning of map
     4      4   Size in bytes of map

--- Map format ---
To work out how many objects in the map there are, divide the size of the map
by 16

Each object in the map is defined by:

Offset   Size   Description
     0      2   Map X position
     2      2   Map Y position
     4      1   Map Z position
     5      2   Type number
     7      1   Frame number
     8      2   Flags
    10      2   * Glob number / Quality
    12      1   ** NPC number
    13      1   ** Map number
    14      2   ID of next object in list (useless for loading?)

* Only applies if object is a glob. I think the object is a glob (See:
GLOB.FLX format) if the type number is 2, but there's still parts missing when
you try draw the map

** Only applies if object is a NPC. All of the NPC information is stored in
map 0 of NONFIXED.DAT

To convert the map XYZ coordinates to screen XY coordinates, use these
formulas:
   ScreenX = (MapX - MapY) / 4
   ScreenY = (MapX + MapY) / 8 - MapZ

GLOB.FLX format
===============
This file contains predefined map sections (Such as floors and walls) and can
be found in the STATIC directory.

--- Header chunk ---
Offset   Size   Description
    84      2   Number of globs in file (g)
   128    g*8   Glob information chunks

--- Glob information chunk ---
Offset   Size   Description
     0      4   Position in file of beginning of glob
                   (Add 1 to this number for actual file position)
     4      4   Size in bytes of glob

--- Glob format ---
Offset   Size   Description
     0      2   Number of objects in GLOB.FLX (n)
     2    n*6   Object information chunks

--- Object information chunks ---
Offset   Size   Description
     0      1   Map X position
     1      1   Map Y position
     2      1   Map Z position
     3      2   Type number
     5      1   Frame number

To convert the map XYZ coordinates to screen XY coordinates, use these
formulas:
   ScreenX = (MapX - MapY) / 2
   ScreenY = (MapX + MapY) / 4 - MapZ

If you're adding it into the map, use the following formulas:
      MapX = MapX * 2 + OriginalMapX
      MapY = MapY * 2 + OriginalMapY
      MapZ = MapZ + OriginalMapZ
   ScreenX = (MapX - MapY) / 4
   ScreenY = (MapX + MapY) / 8 - MapZ
OriginalMapX, OriginalMapY and OriginalMapZ are the coordinates given when
the object in FIXED.DAT or NONFIXED.DAT is a glob. 
Note: DON'T use the 9 lowest bits of OriginalMapX and OriginalMapY
(OriginalMapX &= ~0x1FF; OriginalMapY &= ~0x1FF)

ITEMCACH.DAT format
===================
This file seems to be a temporary item cache for the current map you are on.
I'm guessing that once you go to another map its data is dumped into the
NONFIXED.DAT file. It's found in the GAMEDAT directory or inside U8SAVE.000
in the SAVEGAME directory (See: Getting data from save games).

--- Header chunk ---
Offset   Size   Description
    84      2   Number of files inside ITEMCACH.DAT (Should be 2)
   128    n*8   Information chunks

--- Information chunk ---
Offset   Size   Description
     0      4   Position in ITEMCACH.DAT of beginning of file
     4      4   Size in bytes of file

I'm not sure what the data in the second file is yet, but I know a bit about
the format of the first file. It has information on 9216 objects stored in it
in the following format:

If the object is not an NPC:
  Offset   Size   Description
       0  18432   X positions of objects (9216 2 byte numbers)
   18432  18432   Y positions of objects (9216 2 byte numbers)
   36864   9216   Z positions of objects (9216 1 byte numbers)
   46080  18432   Type numbers of objects (9216 2 byte numbers)
   64512   9216   Frame numbers of objects (9216 1 byte numbers)
   73728  18432   Flags of objects
   92160  18432   Qualities of objects
  110592   9216   * NPC number (9216 1 byte numbers)
  119808   9216   * Map number (9216 1 byte numbers)
  129024  18432   Next object IDs

* Only applies if object is a NPC. It seems the first 256 objects are reserved
for the NPCs

Getting data from save games
============================
The format of a savegame is as follows

Offset   Size   Description
     0     23   Id = `Ultima 8 SaveGame File.'
    23      1   Null byte (0)
    24      1   Number of files inside savegame file

Offset   Size   Description
     0      4   Length of file name (f)
     4      f   File name (Null terminated string)
   4+f      4   Length of data (d)
   8+f      d   Data for file

The original files are stored in U8SAVE.000 in the SAVEGAME directory
