Info about the U8 skf files
---------------------------

The SKF files are used for the intro and endgame sequences.

They are just a simple flex containing a series of 'frames' that the flic
player interpretes to do various things.

I believe that Index 0 in the flex is what can be described as the play list.
It contains what to play, and when to play it.

It consists of 6 byte blocks, divided into 3 int16s, terminated by a
FFFF FFFF FFFF block.
The first int16 is the animation frame at which this action is triggered,
the second int16 the type of action (see list below)
and the third int16 a parameter to the action.

Type 0x03 : Play Music. Data is num in music.flx
Type 0x04 : Slow stop music
Type 0x05 : Play SFX. Data is num in sound.flx
Type 0x06 : Stop SFX.
Type 0x07 : Set Speed (FPS????)
Type 0x08 : Fade to black
Type 0x09 : Fade in (used both after fade to black and fade to white)
Type 0x0C : Wait
Type 0x0E : Play sound (Data is index in the skf)
Type 0x0F : Fade to white
Type 0x12 : Clear subtitles???

The rest of the indices contain the actual frames. There are various types of
data.

The first 2 bytes desribe what type of data.

Here is what I know:

Type 0x00 : Nothing

Type 0x01 : Palette

Type 0x02 : Shape
Same format as a normal shape. However the full size normal header is missing.
The shape is just a single frame. The header in the shapes starts of from the
shapeframe header compression word.
Header {
	uint16	compression;
	uint16	width;
	uint16	height;
	uint16	xoff;
	uint16	yoff;
};

Type 0x0D : Signed 8 Bit Sound
Header {
	uint32	size;
	uint16	samplerate;
	uint16	channels;
	uint8	unused[24];
};
Signed 8bit data follows

Type 0x11 : Subtitle
