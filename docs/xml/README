Quick and dirty guide to generating our documentation
=====================================================

1. Preparations
---------------

To transform the Readme/FAQ you need Xalan, found at http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/ and on that page see what
else you need (Java Development Kit or Java Runtime). 
From the Xalan package you need xalan.jar, xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar.
Copy these files to the same directory that contains the xml and xsl files of the Pentagram Readme/FAQ.


2. Generating the docs
----------------------

- Use the makefiles provided in the directory by running "make".

- Win32 users need to run "make -f makefile.win32" to transform the files.


3. What to do with the files
----------------------------

By running make you get readme.txt/html/dat and faq.txt/html/dat.

- Replace Readme and FAQ in the root directory of the pentagram cvs-module with the text files.

- Copy the text file to the root of the web module and the *.dat files to /content dir of the web module
- To properly use the php files (readme.dat, faq.dat) you have to to strip the
 <test xmlns="test.dtd"> ... </test> stuff surrounding everything else.


4. Misc
-------

- There is a slight incompatibility with the JDK 1.4.x. 
See http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/faq.html#faq-N100CC for details and workaround.
